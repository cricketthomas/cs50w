# Project 2 Flack - Instant Messaging application using Flask-SocketIO and JavScript.

## Summary
In this project, I created a Slack like instant messaging application. Using Socket.io and Flask. In the static folder, there are two files, index.js which contains all the client side code, for collecting form data/inputs, emitting new users, messages, channels and display names along with some style and dom manipulation. The other file, style.css containts custom css. The templates folder contains, 3 files, the layout, which has the nav bar, with channels, and active users div which shows who is logged in. Then there is an index which is the page where users enter their name and channels are created. The current channel file is the channel where the messages are displayed. The applications.py file contains the two routes, two lists for channels and users, and one dictionary for the messages. 
It also has the handling functions for users, channels, messages, and logging in and out. 
## Notes:
The **Personal Touch** feature I added was showing users who is active, and the ability to log out of the application. So users can see if their friends are online and so they can logout from the system.
**Dear CS50w staff, the remembering channel feautre does not work as of today.**
